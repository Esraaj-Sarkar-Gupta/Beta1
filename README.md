The python code has been changed based on which variable was varied for Monte-Carlo simulation. Each directory has the code for each type of simulation. 

The Logs directory contains logs for each instance of the simulation, and carried all the data from each simulation, such that figures can be generated once again by reading this data. I have no included the frames in this repo to save space. However, there are some example result figures in the Examples directory. 

main_v3.py contains the most general code, and you may enter your own variables into the script and generate your own results from it. 

I ran many simulations with various different paramters, all the data of which totals to about 5.5 GB. I have no been able to include them here for obvious reasons and it is for this reason I suggest that you run a simulation yourself if you please. I have included a script to make videos out of the frames (plots) generated.
